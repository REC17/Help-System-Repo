Some origami designs require a larger number of base pairs between helical crossovers than the amount ordinarily required to produce the conventional angles between helices.  The purpose of these extra base pairs is to introduce torsional strain into the system, thereby forcing a portion of a helix to twist or bend.<P>

The path layout is not designed to extend a 7bp grid to accommodate 8 or more nucleotide spaces. When the insert tool is applied to a sequence, an icon is appended to the scaffold that displays the number of nucleotides that have been inserted into the scaffold.  In reality, the nucleotides are not being “inserted,” but rather the locations of the crossovers are being shifted by whatever number of bases.  The crossovers will appear to be in the same location on the path, but they will actually  be further apart from each-other after an insertion.
