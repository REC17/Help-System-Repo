Click this button to toggle on edit mode for the path view.  Edit mode enables three different abilities in the path view:<br></br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
1.	Edit the positions of the 3’ and 5’ ends of the scaffold strand icons in order to create scaffold strands of varying lengths.  This is done by clicking either the triangle icon, which represents the 3’ end, or the square icon, which represents the 5’ end, and dragging it to the desired base position.  The ends of the scaffold strand cannot be moved beyond each other.<br></br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
2.	Reposition the helix paths to facilitate the design process.  In some instances it may be easier to visualize the interactions between adjacent helices if their representative paths are repositioned so that they are side by side.  To move a path, click on the circular helix reference icon at the left hand side of the path and while holding down the mouse button drag the icon to the desired position.  Release the mouse button, and the path will automatically reposition itself to the specified location.<br></br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
3.	Slide the slice bar back and forth across the path lay out.<br></br>
