Click this button to automatically insert staple strands into the path view in locations where unpaired bases are present.  The software will recognize where adjacent helices are and insert staples between helices that will force the structure to assume the desired shape.   It is recommended to avoid clicking this button until scaffold crossovers have been established because many of the staples that are created must be deleted or altered retroactively to insert the neglected crossovers later on.   It is likely that the staple strands will have to be edited regardless of user precaution, so don’t hesitate to insert them prematurely if doing so is preferential.<P>  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The same editing techniques for scaffolds apply for the staple strand.  For more information, refer to strand editing techniques.
